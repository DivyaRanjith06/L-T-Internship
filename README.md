Title: Smart Energy-Saving Room Using Occupancy Count + Ambient Light Sensing (Real Time Occupancy Detection)

Problem Statement: Electricity is often wasted when lights and fans remain switched ON in unoccupied rooms or during daylight hours. Conventional systems relying on motion detection (PIR sensors) are not always reliable, especially when occupants are stationary. This leads to significant energy loss in homes, offices, and classrooms. There is a need for an intelligent system that not only detects room occupancy accurately but also considers ambient light levels to optimize energy usage.

Scope of the Solution: This project presents a smart, microcontroller-based solution that uses two IR sensors to detect entry and exit, maintaining an accurate count of people in a room. It uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to measure ambient light levels. A relay module is used to switch lights ON/OFF based on occupancy and light conditions. The system operates autonomously using an Arduino UNO and can be extended with IoT features using ESP32. It can be deployed in homes, classrooms, meeting rooms, and other smart building environments. A custom-designed PCB with headers for sensors, LDR, and relay module has also been prepared, and the Gerber file is ready for fabrication.

Results: The system was successfully simulated using TinkerCAD, with buttons simulating IR sensor triggers. It accurately detects people entering and leaving the room, maintains the occupancy count, and turns lights ON only when the room is occupied and dark. The Arduino code, Gerber files, and detailed project report have been completed. The system can be expanded to support Wi-Fi control, LCD display, or integration into smart home dashboards. It helps reduce power usage and contributes to energy efficiency in smart buildings.
